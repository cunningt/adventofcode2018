# cunningt's adventofcode2018

I'm trying to learn Golang, and I'm doing the adventofcode challenge as some practice.  I really don't have any Go experience going in, so everything so far has been a challenge.

## Strategies

All of the challenges so far have involved some sort of input set, and have involved a small test set as an example, and then a larger input set that forces better algorithms and data type choices.

My preference is to split the test set out into a *test.txt* file, and bring in the input set as *input.txt* which I can pipe through my programs.

## Lessons
**day 1/day2** : First two days have not been that difficult, and I've learned how to use lists, read from stdin, and use maps.

**day3** : ooh, this got a little more difficult.  Started using struct, started using regexes, started using funcs

**day4** : had to learn timestamps, had to learn how to sort maps, had to learn more about structs

**day5**: learned about runes, ascii representation, string replacement

**day6** : sorting, math functions

## Final Standings
